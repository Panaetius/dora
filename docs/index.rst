DNS Over REST API (D.O.R.A.)
============================

DORA is a web application that provides a simple API for DNS querying through a
REST architecture. It aims to be a consumable API that's easy to digest and
easy to deploy in cloud-based solutions, such as Google App Engine.

DORA relies on dnspython toolkit and the flask microframework.

Sample usage.::

    GET /dora/v1.0/mx/github.com
